Linear Search (Sequential Search)
Definition

Linear Search is a searching algorithm that checks each element one by one in a list or array until the required element is found or the list ends.

Key Points

Works on sorted and unsorted data

Compares elements sequentially

Simple and easy to implement

Not efficient for large datasets

Algorithm Steps

Start from the first element of the array

Compare the current element with the target value

If matched → return index

If not matched → move to next element

If end of array is reached → element not found

Java Implementation
int linearSearch(int[] arr, int key) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == key) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

Example

Array: {5, 8, 2, 9, 1}
Search element: 9

Comparisons:

5 ≠ 9

8 ≠ 9

2 ≠ 9

9 = 9 → Found at index 3

Time Complexity

Best Case: O(1) (element at first position)

Average Case: O(n)

Worst Case: O(n) (element last or not present)

Space Complexity

O(1) (no extra memory used)

Advantages

Easy to understand

No need for sorted data

Suitable for small datasets

Disadvantages

Slow for large datasets

Inefficient compared to binary search

Applications

Searching in small arrays

Unsorted lists

Simple programs and learning purposes
