When the JVM executes a method call, it creates a new stack frame that stores the method’s parameters, local variables, and execution state.
If primitives are passed, their values are copied into the stack frame.
If objects are passed, the reference is copied, while the actual object remains in heap memory.
When the method finishes execution, its stack frame is removed from the call stack in a last-in, first-out manner.
